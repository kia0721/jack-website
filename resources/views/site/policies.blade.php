                </br></br>
                <p> <strong> Junior Academy for Coding Knowledge, Inc. (JACK) </strong> believes that technology can be a tool for enhancing student learning experiences in and out of the classroom.  JACK encourages a dialogue between parents and students in making decisions regarding technology.  The school provides considerable freedom to students in their use of technology. </p>
                <p> <strong> Junior Academy for Coding Knowledge, Inc. (JACK) </strong> provides internet access inside the school premises.  The parents/guardians should be warned that some material accessible via the internet might contain items that are illegal, defamatory, inaccurate, or potentially offensive to some people.  While our intent is to make technological access controversial materials.  We believe that the benefits to students from access to the internet, in the form of information resources  and opportunities for collaboration, exceed any disadvantages.  But ultimately, parents and guardians of minors are responsible for setting and conveying the standards that their children should follow when using media and information sources.  To that end, JACK supports and respects each parents/guardians rights to decide on standards for access.</p>
                <p>Students are responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are in a classroom or inside the school premises.  Communications on the network are often public in nature.  General school rules for behavior and communications apply.</p>
                <p>The network and supporting technology are provided for students to conduct  research and communicate with others about school related matters, not for entertainment purposes.  Access to technological services is given to students who act in a considerate and responsible manner.   Access is a privilege - not a right.  Access entails responsibility.</p>
                <p>Individual users of the computer networks and equipment are responsible for their behavior and communications over those networks.  During class, teachers will guide students toward appropriate materials.  Outside of school premises, parents/guardians bear the same responsibility for such guidance.  Faculty members may limit computer access based on need with academic use taking precedent over all other uses.</p>
                <p> <strong> In order to use technology devices and the JACK networks, students must accept the following responsibilities: </strong> </p>
