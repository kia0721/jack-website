	<h1>ABOUT THE ACADEMY</h1>
	<h5>At the Junior Academy for Coding Knowledge (JACK), we equip kids with the fundamental knowledge and skills to be innovators. <br>
	Believing that anybody can code, JACK was founded in 2016 with the mission to provide an avenue for  kids to become fluent with technology at their early age. Not only does this make them capable of navigating today’s technology-driven world, this also instills such skills as problem solving and critical thinking - skills that will be valuable to them in the long run. <br>
	And the best part? They can do more with coding. We provide a space where kids can learn concepts and do hands-on activities, mixing learning with play, empowering them to create and innovate. Let’s work together in shaping our future creators and digital leaders!
